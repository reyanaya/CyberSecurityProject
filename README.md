# CyberSecurityProject
CS4840 Fall Semester Project
This project focused on the security flaws that SQL queries can have when the proper security measures are not put in place. 
The project implements multiple versions of the same site. One version has allows for SQL injection to show that information unintended for the users of the site can be displayed if they have malicious intent.
The other versions of the site have methods like prepared statements added in that prevent SQL injection from being a security risk.
